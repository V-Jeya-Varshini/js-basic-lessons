                <h1>About me</h1>
                <p class="info">I am V. Jeya Varshini. With a Bachelor's degree in ELectronics and Communication, I started my career in the software field as a Trainee Engineer in Chain-Sys Software Exports Pvt. Ltd. Though I didn't have more knowledge in Programming languages in the beginning, I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me. My learning journey at Chain-Sys helped me a lot to devolop my programming skills.</p>
                <p class="info">Do you realize that the only functionality of a web application that the user directly interacts with is through the web page? Implement it poorly and, to the user, the server-side becomes irrelevant! Today’s user expects a lot out of the web page: it has to load fast, expose the desired service, and be comfortable to view on all devices: from a desktop computers to tablets and mobile phones.</p>
                <p class="info">In my learning journey, I learned the basic tools that every web page coder needs to know. I started from the ground up by learning how to implement modern web pages with HTML and CSS. Then I learned how to code our pages such that its components rearrange and resize themselves automatically based on the size of the user’s screen. Now I can able to code up a web page that will be just as useful on a mobile phone as on a desktop computer. No “pinch and zoom” required! Last but certainly not least, I got a thorough introduction to the most ubiquitous, popular, and incredibly powerful language of the web: Javascript. Using Javascript, I can able to build a fully functional web application that utilizes Ajax to expose server-side functionality and data to the end user.</p>
